# Personal-Artificial-Voice-Assistant
My first project is an AI system inspired by Jarvis from the Iron Man movie. I built it using guidance from YouTube tutorials and my Python programming book. This AI can access my computer files, open any website through the browser, play songs stored on my computer, and answer questions by using Wikipedia as its knowledge base.

In my project, I have imported several Python libraries to enhance functionality. These include pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, datetime for handling date and time operations, speech_recognition for processing voice commands, and wikipedia for retrieving information. I also used webbrowser to open websites, os for file and system operations, and keyboard for capturing keyboard inputs. Additionally, I incorporated random for generating random values, sounddevice and numpy for audio processing, pyautogui for automating GUI tasks, and time for managing delays. To extend capabilities further, I added cv2 for computer vision tasks, subprocess for running external processes, and colorama for colored text output in the terminal.
