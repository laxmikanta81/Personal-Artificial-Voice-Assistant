# Personal-Artificial-Voice-Assistant
My first project is an AI system inspired by Jarvis from the Iron Man movie. I built it using guidance from YouTube tutorials and my Python programming book. This AI can access my computer files, open any website through the browser, play songs stored on my computer, and answer questions by using Wikipedia as its knowledge base.
